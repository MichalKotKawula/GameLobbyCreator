## Meeting Schedules

Weekly Meeting: Tuesday 1:00 - 1:20PM using Teams

## Programming Practices to be adopted

As a group we will try to narrow it down to a couple of straightforward principles:

- Keeping things as simple as possible.
- Creating detailed documentation of complex code and personal logic.
- Optimizing functions that slow down the user experience.
- Avoiding duplications.


## Merging and Working with Code

Creating and working on your branch:
```
git branch (your branch name)
git checkout (your branch name)
```

Updating your files in your branch:
```
git add (your files)
git commit -m "(relavent message)"
git push origin (your branch name)
```

Merging your branch into main:
```
git add (your files)
git commit -m "(relavent message)"
git push origin (your branch name)

After this click the compare and pull request promt on github
```
