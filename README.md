# Project Description

A website used to match online players together on PC for games that don't have matchmaking or limited choice on what type of teammates you need. The most important feature for this website is the matchmaking tool that allows users to select a game, choose if they want to host the game or find a group hosting already, and choose from a variety of options to curate their matchmaking results. Other features include allowing users to vote on the next game to be supported, select the region they want to play in, and rate users they match with on how good of a teammate they were.

## Matchmaking Feature

This tool is the main feature users will interact with after their account is made and signed in. They have the option to choose a game from a list of supported games, select whether they want to host the game or look for a host, and then finally select from a variety of curated choices designed for that game to filter their matching making results. Once the above steps are completed they are placed in que until they find teammates, the user does have the option to cancel here if they so choose. Once teammates are found depending on the game, the information to join the host is displayed and the team can now be joined together. 

## Vote For The Next Game Feature

On the right side of the website there is going to be a voting section for the next supported game. Users can only vote once logged in, and cannot vote for a second time. After a defined time is reached (let's say a month), the voting will close and the development to add that game to the list of supported would begin. After some time this process would repeat again.

## Game Maintenance

On the select a game portion of the site, a site administrator can click into open a edit window for a selected game. Here they can edit the name, icon, description, and the search options users can pick from. The admin also can remove the game if need be. The admin can also add a new game by clicking the "+" symbol only a admin can see beside the game selection portion of the site. This would open the same window as the edit screen but completely blank.


## Rate Users

After a match will finish, users will be prompted to rate their teammates on the scale from 1 to 5 based on their in-game performance. The reviews will be added up together and divided by the total number of reviews resulting in an average score which will come in helpfull for others in determining their potential temmates reliability. 


## Clan System

Users of the site will be able to form clans with other players throughout registering their clan name, description and adding other users to the group. Each clan name should be unique and consit of less than 50 members. Clan membership id by invitation only. The creator needs to search for other members. Inside a clan a match date can be set also inculding the available positions to be filled by its members. There will also be an option to upload a custom banner for the team if desired.


## Notification System

Users will be able to see alerts regarding their account such as clan invites and messages in the navbar of the site. The notification system will only show new alerts. There will be an option to block or unblock site members from sending notifications. Users will be granted the ability to send out clan wide notifications regarding matches or simple messages.
