## Technology Stack

We want to use the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack to develop this website.

## Front-End

- Html
- Css
- Js
- Bootstrap
- ReactJs

For the front-end of the site of course we are going to use the basic foundations of HTML, Css, Js since this is going to be a website. Bootstrap is going to be used to structure the site and make it more responsive to window size changing. 

ReactJs is going to be our choice for additional Js libaries since most likly we are going to build this site by placing each feature within its own components. Two-way data binding is going to be very helpful when it comes to users navigating back and fourth between pages. Pre-rendering pages should help make the site feel responsive overall to the users unlike if we were not using ReactJs.

## Back-End

- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- NodeJs


NodeJs will serve as a base run-time environment as well as to reach MongoDB and provide frameworks from ExpressJS. MongoDB will be used to store and access crucial information such as profile, clan, etc. MongoDB stored information will be accessible through custom API to improve efficiency.
